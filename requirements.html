    <h2>1. floor</h2><br>
    <p>floor is very important as a calisthenics athelete. you can perform most of the workouts like push up, squats, sit ups, plank etc in a floor. im sure you all have a floor. you can do these workouts at your house or even in the streets</p><br><br>
    <h2>2. pull up bar</h2><br>
    <p>a pull up bar is one of the most important element for a real calisthenics athelete, here you can perform jaw dropping moves and skills like airwalk, front lever, muscle up, ice cream makers etc. if you do workout at your house and dont have a bar then you can use your table as a bar for austrailian pull ups or front lever practices, just simply hold the edge of the table and put your leg inside and start practicing your reps, but if you still lack table than adjust your doors properly so that it may not slip, than use the door as your pull ups bar.</p>
